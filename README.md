What have I programmed?

This code extracts prices of MacBook Air M1 from eBay UK website, filters out any abnormal prices, calculates the average price, and saves the date and average price to a CSV file.

The code uses a third-party module called BeautifulSoup to parse HTML source code, and NumPy to manipulate arrays of data. The CSV module is used to write data to a file. The script also uses the requests module to send an HTTP GET request to a URL to retrieve the HTML code.

The script provides the average price of MacBook Air M1 sold on eBay UK on a given day and saves this information to a CSV file.


Why did I build it?

When I was planning to buy an M1 MacBook Air, I wanted to make sure that I didn't overpay for the product. However, looking for the average price manually was time-consuming and difficult because there were thousands of listings to go through. That's when I decided to build this code. Since then, I have used this code to ensure that I don't overpay for a wide range of products from various websites. I find it satisfying to create code that can solve real-world problems and simplify tasks that would otherwise be tedious or difficult.
